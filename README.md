## 🎯 Project Overview

This project presents a sophisticated **Financial AI Assistant** built by fine-tuning the Mistral 7B model on wealth management conversations. The AI acts as an intelligent investment advisor that analyzes client profiles, assesses risk tolerance, and provides personalized investment recommendations.

### ✨ Key Features

🔍 **Intelligent Risk Assessment** - Analyzes client responses to determine risk tolerance and investment capacity

📊 **Goal-Based Planning** - Understands client financial objectives and time horizons

💼 **Personalized Recommendations** - Generates tailored investment profiles based on comprehensive analysis

🤝 **Natural Conversations** - Engages clients through intuitive dialogue, mimicking experienced wealth managers

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system is built on a fine-tuned **Mistral 7B Instruct** model, optimized for financial advisory conversations using:

- **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** for efficient fine-tuning
- **4-bit Quantization** for memory-efficient training
- **Gradient Checkpointing** for optimal resource utilization
- **Custom conversation formatting** with risk category integration

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Core ML libraries
torch>=2.0.0
transformers>=4.30.0
datasets>=2.12.0
peft>=0.4.0

# Data processing
pandas>=1.5.0
json

# Training optimization

## 💾 Dataset Format

The training data follows a structured conversation format:

```json
{
  "conversation": [
    {
      "role": "human",
      "content": "I'm looking to invest $50,000 for my retirement in 20 years..."
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant", 
      "content": "Based on your timeline and goals, let me ask a few questions..."
    }
  ],
  "risk_calculation": {
    "risk_category": "Moderate"
  }
}
```

## ⚙️ Training Configuration

The model uses optimized hyperparameters for financial domain adaptation:

| Parameter | Value | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| LoRA Rank | 8 | Efficient adaptation |
| Learning Rate | 1e-4 | Stable convergence |
| Batch Size | 1 (32 grad accum) | Memory efficiency |
| Max Length | 256 tokens | Conversation context |
| Epochs | 3 | Prevent overfitting |
